# funddaata2022-assessment

This repository contains the exercises and project required for Module *Fundamentals of Data Analysis* as part of the H. Dip in Computer Programming and Data Analysis course at <a href="https://www.gmit.ie" target="_top">Atlantic Technological University, Galway</a>


There are five smaller notebooks containing smaller weekly exercises and a larger notebook titled Normal-Distribution-Notebook.ipynb which contains the larger project.  There are 6 notebooks in total. 

Firstly, I set up the relevant programming environment by installing relevant packages to my machine:
•	Python (Anaconda) - Installing the full Anaconda version of Python as Anaconda has the libraries already installed
•	Jupyter Notebook -platform on which Python is run
•	Visual Studio (VS) Code - for doing my README.md write up
•	Cmdr - to Navigate through directories and to open Jupyter notebook within the required Directory
o	As I am using a Windows machine, Cmdr is a more user friendly command line than the Windows Command Prompt


In GitHub, I set up my repository titled Programming-For-Data-Analysis-2022 in my Github account and cloned my project repository to my machine using the git clone command in Cmdr. I left my repository public so that my work could be accessed publically. I made sure that my repository contained a README.md file.
Once the repository was successfully cloned to my machine I opened Jupyter Notebook in the repository using the ``Jupyter Notebook`` command. This opens Jupyter Notebook as a local browser.
From here, I set up a new Jupyter Notebook titled *Programming for Data Analysis Project 2022.pynb* by clicking 'new' Python 3(ipykernel) and started work on my project.
Using the git add ., git commit -m" " and git push commands in Cmdr, I have pushed up my updated work to GitHub as frequently as possible.
