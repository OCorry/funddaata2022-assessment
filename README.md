This repository contains the exercises and project required for Module *Fundamentals of Data Analysis* as part of the H. Dip in Computer Programming and Data Analysis course at <a href="https://www.gmit.ie" target="_top">Atlantic Technological University, Galway</a>

There are five smaller notebooks containing the weekly exercises and a larger notebook titled *Normal-Distribution-Notebook.ipynb* which contains the larger project.  There are six notebooks in total. 


# <font color=darkred>Setup of the Environment</font>
***

Firstly, I set up the relevant programming environment by installing relevant packages to my machine:

- Python (Anaconda) - Installing the full Anaconda version of Python as Anaconda has the libraries already installed

- Jupyter Notebook - Platform on which I ran Python to carry out my exercises and project

-	Cmder - to Navigate through directories and to open Jupyter notebook within the required Directory
  - As I am using a Windows machine, Cmder is a more user friendly command line than the Windows Command Prompt


In <a href="[https://www.gmit.ie](https://github.com/)" target="_top">github</a>, I set up my repository titled **funddata2022-assessment** in my Github account and cloned my project repository to my machine. I did this by clicking the green **Code** box and copying the HTTPS link. Then back in Cmder command line, using the the ``git clone command`` followed by the copied HTTPS link and hitting return, I saved my repository in my preferred folder on my own machine. 


When creating my repository in Github, I left it public so that my work could be accessed publically. I made sure that my repository contained a README.md file.
Once the repository was successfully cloned to my machine I opened Jupyter Notebook in the repository using the ``Jupyter Notebook`` command in Cmder. This opens Jupyter Notebook as a local browser.
From here, I set up a new Folder called **Practicals**. To create a new Notebook, I clicked 'new' Python 3(ipykernel) and I have stored my 6 Notebooks in the Practicals Folder.


Using the ``git add .``, ``git commit -m" "`` and ``git push`` commands in Cmder, I have pushed up my updated work to GitHub as frequently as possible.

# <font color=darkred>Interacting with the Notebooks' code</font>
***
In order for user to be able to interact my Notebooks, the user will first need to get them down to their own machine. This can be done by right clicking on the **Raw** button and clicking *Save Link As*. Then save the Notebook to your desired folder on your machine. 

Next, in Cmder, firstly use the ``cd`` (change directory) command to navigate to the Folder that contains the Notebook.  Then type *Jupyter Notebook* and hit return. The Notebook will then open in a local browser and code can be interacted with.
