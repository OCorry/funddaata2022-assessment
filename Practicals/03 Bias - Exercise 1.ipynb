This illustrates the effect cognitive bias can have on peoples' minds and more importantly, the idea that a lot of the time, people dont even believe that they can be influenced in any way. The science of data analysis is no different, and is also susceptible to the concept of cognitve bias <a href=\"https://www.integrate.io/blog/cognitive-biases-in-data-science/.\" target=\"_top\">Abe Dearmer, 2021<sup>4</sup></a>."

    "Anchoring bias occurs when an individual is influenced by something or a particular piece of information they have come by. This leads to the individual making an influenced decision that they may not have made had they not come by the particular piece of information. While the decision may turn out to be a correct decision, the influence of anchoring bias may also lead to poor decision making, <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/anchoring-bias\" target=\"_top\">indeed, 2022<sup>6</sup></a>. According to  <a href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/what-is-the-anchoring-bias.html\" target=\"_top\">Eleanor Myers, 2022<sup>7</sup></a>, anchoring bias can be influenced by factors such as one's mood, personality and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Achoring bias could be illustrated using the following example:\n",
    "Purchasing a new pair of jeans. An individual sees a pair of jeans at a price of €100.00 and then moves through the shop and comes across another pair of similar jeans priced at €75.00. Because they have already seen the first pair for €100.00, they see the €75.00 pair as a bargain and purchase the second pair of jeans for €75.00. Here, the decision to buy the second pair of jeans was influenced by what the individual had seen before hand. Would the indiviual have considered the second pair of jeans a bargain had they not first seen the pair for €100.00 and consequently would they have bought the second pair of jeans had they not seen the first pair? Did they even really need the pair of jeans or should they have kept their €75.00 for something else?\n"

    "The bandwagon effect essentially means that an individual is influenced by the actions and beliefs of others. Again, in certain instances, positive decisions can come about from the bandwagon effect but bad decision making is also associated with it. The bandwagon effect can even influence an individual to override their own beliefs and thoughts about a topic or situation <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bandwagon-effect.asp\" target=\"_top\">Investopedia<sup>8</sup></a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A really evident example of the bandwagon effect in today's society is that of social media. Over the years, social media has become a part of most peoples daily lives.

    "\n",
    "Social media is influencing people every day whether it be by adverts, by *influencers*, or more closer to home, even by peoples' own peers. Individuals are influenced and convinced by what they see on social media and make decisions based on what they see and read. When they are influenced, they can overlook their own thoughts and beliefs and follow the crowd because that seems to be the right or *popular* thing to do according, to social media. "

    "To illustrate for example, take a senior business person at a financial company who is so confident in their expertise, their work and their research into a new deal that they fail to see warning signs of potential failure in the deal.

    "The individual ignores all warning signs and proceeds with the deal, which after a few months runs into the ground and loses their company hundreds of thousands of euro. The individual was so engrossed in their own confidence that all of the warning signals were disrgarded by them."
